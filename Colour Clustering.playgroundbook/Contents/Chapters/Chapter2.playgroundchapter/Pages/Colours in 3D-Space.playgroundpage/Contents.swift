 # Colours as points in 3D-space
 
 Now that we have seen how we can represent each colour by three values, we can consider each colour as a point in *3D-space*.
 For this we simply use the colour's red component as its X-coordinate, the green component as its Y-coordinate, and the blue component as its Z-coordinate.
 
 Using this idea, we can visualise the colours of an image by plotting the colour of every pixel in a 3D coordinate system.
 
 * experiment:
 Can you see how the colours in some images form clusters? Later, we will represent each cluster by a single colour.

 â€”
 
 * Note:
 You can rotate the coordinate system to look at it from different angles.
